# MontyHallSim
A C# executable which allows you to simulate the Monty Hall Problem

Description of the Monty Hall brain teaser can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem

When launched you will be prompted to enter the number of doors to use in the simulation how many times to run the simulation and whether you wish to switch to the offered door or stay with your originally selected door. Your door is selected at random and the offered door for switchin folows the logic set out in the original problem.
